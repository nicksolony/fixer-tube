There's a very good chance that you have a blown capacitor. Often times you will hear the outside unit buzz for a few seconds as if trying to start and then stops. In this video I show you how to locate, read the rating, replace, and measure the dual capacitor. This is the most common air conditioner repair. BUT.. Keep in mind that this is not a fix it all repair. Its common, but there could be many other things that can go wrong. Let me know in the comments below if you have a problematic AC. I will try to walk you through it ;)", url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C82HvbvP08E", brand_id:6 ,category_id: 13},
